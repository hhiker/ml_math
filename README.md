This repo keeps tex and pdf files of the record of the journey I teach myself
Mathematics while I am learning Machine Learning. It may contain mathematical
proofs I make, clarity about the mathematical concepts, development of some
some math subject and other related things. Currently it has:

## /proofs

### Mathematical Proof

* least_squire:         Some proof about the trace of Matrix.
* trace_of_matrix:      A detailed proof of getting the close form solution of least square method.
* object_similarity:    A detailed proof of getting the weight of one attribute
  to make each attribute's influence equal when computing overall dissimilarity
  of one clusters.
* k_means_within_point_scatter_deviation:    The overall within-point
  dissimilarity can be replaced with the summation of dissimilarity between
  each point in the cluster and the cluster mean. Here is a detailed proof.

## /development

### Development of Some Math Subjects

Words in this category is not inclusive at all. Further amendment will always
be performed as I learn and understand new things.

* development_of_algebra:               Development of Algebra

## /information_theory

### Understand of Information Theory

* understanding_entropy:    Shannon Entropy

## /real_number_system

Construction of Real Number System

This part is intended for real number system, however, for now it only has:

* the_natural_number: Construction of Real Number.

## /algebra

### Learning algrebra bottom-up or from intuition to abstraction.

* algebra:  Now the construction of algrebraic structure has reached field.

## /probability_theory_and_statistics

### Learning probability theory and statistics bottom-up or from intuition to abstraction.

* probability_theory_and_statistics: This is the notes taken along with the
  journey I learn probability theory and statistics.

## /reference_lib: lib for bibtex
