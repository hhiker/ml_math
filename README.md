This repo keeps tex and pdf files of the record of the journey I teach myself
Mathematics while I am learning Machine Learning. It may contain mathematical
proofs I make, clarity about the mathematical concepts, development of some
some math subject and other related things. Currently it has:

## /proofs:      Mathematical Proof

* least_squire:     Some proof about the trace of Matrix.
* trace_of_matrix:  A detailed proof of getting the close form solution of least square method.

## /development: Development of Some Math Subjects

Words in this category is not inclusive at all. Further amendment will always
be performed as I learn and understand new things.

* development_of_algebra:               Development of Algebra
* evolvement_of_probability_theory:     Evolvement of Probability Theory

## /information_theory: Understand of Information Theory

* understanding_entropy:    Shannon Entropy
